# Professional ML Engineer Certification resources 
> A Professional Machine Learning Engineer **designs, builds, and productionizes ML models** to solve business challenges using Google Cloud technologies and knowledge of proven ML models and techniques. The ML Engineer considers responsible AI throughout the **ML development process, and collaborates closely with other job roles to ensure long-term success of models**. The ML Engineer should be proficient in all aspects of **model architecture, data pipeline interaction, and metrics interpretation**. The ML Engineer needs familiarity with **foundational concepts of application development, infrastructure management, data engineering, and data governance**. Through an understanding of **training, retraining, deploying, scheduling, monitoring, and improving models**, the ML Engineer designs and creates **scalable solutions for optimal performance**.

### Tips and planing
* Deep understand of ML
* Deep dive of algorithms
* The above is the base to implements and deliver a production ready ML system
* Communication and business acumen, to understand the client needs and be able do like a daily interactions, proper design choices
* good prototyping, there are a lot of innovative ideas and how to effectively manage the process from the ideation to execution and be able to quickly build a prototype to establish initial value for the business that is really important

* how to translate the business problem into a machine learning one, and also detect what kind of problem can be solve with ML and what not
* understand the engineer part of the end-to-end solution
